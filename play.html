               just at the corner nearest the road, where the goats used to get in, a
               man rode up and asked me was my name Guido, and gave me this letter,
               signed ‘Your Father’s Friend,’ bidding me be here to-day if I would
               know the secret of my birth, and telling me how to recognise the
               writer!  I had always thought old Pedro was my uncle, but he told me
               that he was not, but that I had been left a child in his charge by
               some one he had never since seen.</p>
